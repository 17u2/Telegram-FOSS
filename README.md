## Telegram-FOSS

[Telegram](http://telegram.org) is a messaging app with a focus on speed and security. Itâ€™s superfast, simple and free.

This is an unofficial, FOSS friendly fork of the original [Telegram App for Android](https://github.com/DrKLO/Telegram).

Several proprietary parts were removed from the original Telegram client, including Google Play Services for the location services and HockeySDK for self-updates. Push notifications through Google Cloud Messaging and the automatic SMS receiving features were also removed.

This version of Telegram is available on FDroid:
